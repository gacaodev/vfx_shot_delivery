# About the copy_machine.py

This is my first python programm apart from initial syntax and coding practices, so the program might not be perfectly designed.

The only inputs the programm allows you are folder names and number of handles. By default I've set the program to look for folder with this naming convention: ABC_123_123_123. But you could modify this by the name of your own projects or even create a SQL database for the names of the project and then set the behaviour of your program in base of that.
