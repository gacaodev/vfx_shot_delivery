# About the copy_machine.py

This is my first python terminal app apart from initial syntax and coding practices, so the program might not be perfectly designed.

The only inputs the programm allows you to set are the folder names and the number of handles. By default I've set the app to look for folders with this naming convention: ABC_123_123_123. But you could modify this by the name of your own projects or even create a SQL database for the names of your projects and then set the behaviour of the app in base of that.
